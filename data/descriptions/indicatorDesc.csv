Puntaje de Colorado EnviroScreen,,generated  June 2022,Score value,"County, Census Tract, Census Block Group","The EnviroScreen Score combines population characteristics and environmental burdens. The score goes from 0 to 100, with the highest score representing the highest burden.
The EnviroScreen score is a percentile, which is like a ranking. The number represents how many of the state’s counties, census tracts, or census block groups have a lower score than the area in question.
Suppose a county has an EnviroScreen score of 70. This means its EnviroScreen score is higher than 70% of all counties in Colorado. In other words, 70% of counties in Colorado are less likely to be affected by environmental health injustices than the selected county. 
Suppose a census tract has an EnviroScreen score of 20. This means its EnviroScreen score is higher than 20% of all census tracts in Colorado. In other words, 20% of counties in Colorado are less likely to be affected by environmental health injustices than the selected census tract, or 80% of census tracts in Colorado are more likely to be affected by environmental health injustices than the selected census tracts. "
Contaminación y carga climática,,generated  June 2022,Score value,"County, Census Tract, Census Block Group","The Pollution and Climate Burden score combines the scores from the following components: Environmental Exposures, Environmental Effects, and Climate Burden.

The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores being worse. The environmental exposures score does not cover all pollutants; it is the average of data on diesel particulate matter, traffic proximity, ozone, PM 2.5, air toxics, other air pollutants, lead exposure risk, drinking water violations, and noise."
Efectos ambientales,,generated  June 2022,Score value,"County, Census Tract, Census Block Group","The environmental effects score represents how many hazardous or toxic sites are in a community relative to the rest of the state. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score being worse. The score is the average of data on proximity to mining, oil and gas operations, impaired surface waters, wastewater discharge facilities, Superfund sites, facilities that use hazardous chemicals, and facilities that generate, treat, store, or dispose of hazardous wastes. As most people are not directly exposed to these sites, this score is weighted half as much as environmental exposures in the overall Pollution and Climate Burden score."

The score ranges from 0 to 100, the higher the score, the higher the burden."
Poblaciones sensibles,,generated  June 2022,Score value,"County, Census Tract, Census Block Group","The sensitive populations score captures how at risk a community is to environmental exposures and climate impacts as it relates to health. For example, air pollution has stronger impacts on older and younger people, and people with chronic conditions such as asthma. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score being worse. The score is calculated using data on asthma hospitalization rate, cancer prevalence, diabetes prevalence, heart disease prevalence, life expectancy, low birth weight rate, mental health, population over 65, and population under 5."
